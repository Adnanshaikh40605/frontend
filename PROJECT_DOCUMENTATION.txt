# BLOG CMS PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack blog content management system (CMS) built with React for the frontend and Django for the backend. The system allows for creating, editing, and managing blog posts, as well as handling comments and user interactions.

## Project Structure

### Frontend (React)
The frontend is organized in a modular structure:

```
frontend/
  ├── public/           # Static files
  ├── src/
  │   ├── api/          # API service functions
  │   ├── assets/       # Images, fonts, and other static resources
  │   ├── components/   # Reusable UI components
  │   ├── context/      # React context providers
  │   ├── hooks/        # Custom React hooks
  │   ├── pages/        # Page components (routes)
  │   └── utils/        # Utility functions
```

### Backend (Django)
The backend follows Django's standard structure:

```
backend/
  ├── blog/             # Main Django app
  │   ├── migrations/   # Database migrations
  │   ├── models.py     # Data models
  │   ├── serializers.py # REST API serializers
  │   ├── urls.py       # URL configurations
  │   └── views.py      # API views
```

## Key Components

### Frontend Components

1. **BlogPostCard.jsx** - Displays a card preview of a blog post with image, title, excerpt, and metadata.

2. **BlogPostPage.jsx** - Renders an individual blog post with full content, featured image, comments section, and sharing options.

3. **BlogListPage.jsx** - Displays a list of blog posts with search functionality and pagination.

4. **PostDetailPage.jsx** - Admin view for a single post with edit, delete, and publish functionality.

5. **CommentForm.jsx** - Form for users to submit comments on blog posts.

6. **Comment.jsx** - Displays a single comment with author information and content.

### Context Providers

1. **BlogContext** - Manages blog posts state and operations (fetch, create, update, delete).

2. **CommentContext** - Manages comments state and operations (fetch, create, approve, reject).

### API Services

1. **blogPostService** - Handles all API calls related to blog posts with error handling and caching:
   - Advanced error handling with fallback UI for failed requests
   - Request caching to prevent duplicate requests
   - Timeout handling to prevent hanging requests
   - Image upload handling with multipart/form-data

2. **commentService** - Handles all API calls related to comments with error handling:
   - Comment creation, approval, and rejection
   - Pagination support for comment lists
   - Bulk operations for comment moderation

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:

- API request timeouts (10 seconds)
- Fallback UI for failed API requests
- Form validation before submission
- User-friendly error messages
- Placeholder images for failed image loads

## Image Handling

The system supports:

- Featured images for posts
- Additional image galleries for posts
- Fallback placeholder images using base64-encoded SVGs
- Image preview in admin interface
- Responsive image rendering
- Error handling for image loading failures

## Authentication

The Django backend handles authentication for admin operations:
- Admin users can create/edit/delete posts
- Comment moderation requires authentication
- Django REST Framework permissions control access

## Deployment

The project is structured to support deployment with:

- Static file handling for production builds
- API proxy configuration for development
- Environment-specific settings
- Separate frontend and backend deployments

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

1. **Comment submission errors**:
   - Ensure the postId is correctly passed to the CommentForm component
   - Verify the backend API endpoint is correctly configured
   - Check for CORS issues if frontend and backend are on different domains

2. **Image loading issues**:
   - The system uses fallback placeholder images for failed image loads
   - Images are served from the Django media directory
   - Check media permissions if images aren't displaying

3. **API connection issues**:
   - The frontend uses axios with timeout handling
   - Check network connectivity and backend server status
   - Verify proxy settings in development environment
